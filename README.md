## Introduction

Implementation of image sorting based on image similarity. The algorithm to get hash value of the specific image includes **Average hash**(aHash), **Different hash**(dHash), **Perceptual hash**(pHash) and **Color moments** algorithm. *Hamming distance* is used to measure the similarity between two images.

## Usage
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

run __image_sort.py__
